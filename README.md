# Project Name: CommunionHub [Live Link](https://easy-communion-hub.web.app)


## Short Description of CommunionHub:
**CommunionHub** is a dynamic React web app designed to connect people across faiths through meaningful events. Like a digital gathering place, it allows users to explore, filter, and add events with ease. The platform features secure authentication via email, password, and Google sign-in, ensuring a safe and personalized experience. With JWT-based security, only registered users can contribute by adding events, while everyone can browse event listings and details. Whether it's a religious gathering, social meet-up, or charity event, CommunionHub bridges communities, fostering unity and engagement. Think of it as a virtual bulletin board where faith and fellowship come together.


## Challenges Faced During CommunionHub Development: 
During the development of CommunionHub, several challenges were encountered and overcome. Implementing secure authentication with email-password and Google login required careful handling of user sessions and JWT token storage. Ensuring proper authorization for event creation was another hurdle. Matching the UI to the reference design while maintaining responsiveness across devices took multiple refinements. Additionally, filtering events dynamically and managing state efficiently posed difficulties. Overcoming these challenges involved debugging authentication flows, optimizing UI components, and fine-tuning API interactions. Ultimately, the project successfully delivers a seamless user experience, enabling secure event creation, discovery, and participation within an inclusive community platform.
